**Stock Market Forecasting with LSTM Model**

This project aims to build an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model using 3 years of historical stock market data. The goal is to train the model to predict stock prices for upcoming days, based on the past performance and trends observed in the data.

**Features:**

Preprocessing of stock market data

Implementation of LSTM neural network for time series forecasting

Training on 3 years of historical stock data

Forecasting stock prices for future days

**Requirements:**

Python 3.x

TensorFlow or PyTorch

**Future Work:**

Expand the model to include more advanced forecasting techniques

Integrate additional market indicators

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib for visualizations

yfinance for stock market data retrieval
