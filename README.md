**Stock Market Forecasting with LSTM Model**

This project aims to build an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model using 3 years of historical stock market data. The goal is to train the model to predict stock prices for upcoming days, based on the past performance and trends observed in the data.

**Features:**

Preprocessing of stock market data

Implementation of LSTM neural network for time series forecasting

Training on 3 years of historical stock data

Forecasting stock prices for future days

**Requirements:**

Python 3.x

TensorFlow or PyTorch

**Future Work:**

Expand the model to include more advanced forecasting techniques

Integrate additional market indicators

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib for visualizations

yfinance for stock market data retrieval

**Disclaimer:** The predictions generated by this model are intended for educational purposes only. The model uses past stock prices to try and identify patterns, but stock prices are influenced by many factors, such as economic conditions, global events, and company-specific news, which the model cannot predict.


The performance of the model, shown through the RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), is based on past data and does not guarantee accuracy for future stock prices. Stock prices are volatile and may change due to random factors that the model cannot account for.


Before making any investment decisions, it is strongly recommended to consult a financial advisor or conduct your own research. The predictions should not be the sole basis for your investment strategies, and we are not responsible for any financial losses incurred from using these predictions.
